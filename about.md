I'm Alejandro Rangel, I'm Software Developer I have been coding sinces I was 10 years old.
While I don't think I'm particularly good at one language, I think I really excels on knowing
one or two things in multiple language. I just like to code and I find really interesting to
learn different approaches to solve the same problem.

Where the name of this blog came from? I don't really know, I create this blog in 2016 and never
update it, until recently. I guess it came from the Netflix show Love Death + Robots.
