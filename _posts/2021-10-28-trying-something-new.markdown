All right I kept my promise of continuing this blog, I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it on a daily
basis but I'll try.

So I have a new iPad that suspose to be really powerfull, what can I do with it? code something duh!
The main problem is iPadOS while the hardware is really powerful (allegedly) I think there are not enough
tools for me to test it.

So... I'll try to use what I have at my disposal which is Swift Playgrounds, which is kind of like a lite
version of XCode. I think I can use it to learn SwiftUI and Swift which for what I look are quite similar
to Kotlin.

I'm not completly sure what I would like to do as a side project, but probably it would be something related
to D&D or ML. BTW there is an upcoming version of Swift Playgrounds that it would be more robust. Let's hope
I can test it sooner that later.
