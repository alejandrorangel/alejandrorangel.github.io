This is my first entry since 2016 so it's been a while since my last post. I'm trying to use my iPad as a blogging tool, so all of this is a little bit weird for me.
Definitely having a web version of vscode is helping a lot, I was thinking to change my personal site to use
something like react but I think Jekyll is a good tool for my needs.

What I would like to blog about? I don't know really, but probably it would be a little bit of what I do
on my day to day work, a little bit of React Native, Android, Machine Learning, etc.

One thing is for sure I need to update my personal page link to this website instead of using FB. Let's hope
my next post would be in less than 4 years.
